# SAP Datasphere

# Description
This repository is an introduction of SAP Datasphere, a data warehouse platform built on the SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP).

# Overview
Two years ago, SAP Datasphere was introduced. I was tasked with exploring its features to determine how we could leverage it to address the pain points within our existing SAP BI solution, which relies heavily on ABAP CDS views created in the S/4HANA called embedded analytics.

I delved into SAP Datasphere and developed some Proof of Concepts (POCs). Unfortunately, I did not keep the detailed records at that time. Since I have some time now, I revisited the tool and documented my insights and thoughts here. Hope this documentation will help you gain a better understanding of SAP Datasphere.
