# Administration

**Create Tenant** 
- Tenant is the environment within the SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP) where you can manage data and resources.
it is a common practice to create separate tenants for development (DEV), quality assurance (QAS), and production (PROD) environments in **SAP Datasphere**.

**Create Space** 
- Space a very important concept in **SAP DataSphere**. It is similar to the **workspace** in Azure Fabric/PowerBI. 

We can see the objects created in the current space and find the objects shared with you but created in the different spaces. 

SAP recommends creating multiple spaces for dedicated functionalities. We may need to create a dedicated space for administration. It it better to create a dedicated space to manage the virtual tables.

I will skip the transport and security parts.
