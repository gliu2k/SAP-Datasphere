# Business Builder 

It is the tool for the business users to create their own models from the business perspectives. (I am not sure. I have not seen such in my past experience. It is very hard for the business user to create a ad-hoc query)




All the dimensiuon and fact business entties must be **craeated** on top of the existed **data builder objects** (tables or views). 

As these buinsee entinies are created by the bueinss user, all the complex logic must be completed in the objects creetted in the data buider. In the budiness entiy, limted function of manulaty data is aviaile like associon and filter.
