# Business Builder 

It is the tool designed for the **business users** to create their own models from the business perspectives.

<pre>ðŸ˜Š Honestly I am not sure if it can work as expected. In my past experience, I have not encountered this before. 
   It is quite challenging for business users to create ad-hoc queries.</pre>

- **Dimension** and **Fact**
Both business entities must be **craeated** on top of the existed **Data Builder** objects(tables or views). 



As all the business objects are supposed to be created by the business users, they only have limited functionatities to operate on the data. All the complex logic must be done in the **Data Builder** objects.
