# Business Builder 

It is a tool designed for **business users** to create their own models from the business perspectives.

<pre>Honestly, I am not sure if it can work as expected. Creating ad-hoc queries can be quite challenging for business users.😊 </pre>

## 1. Create Business Entities

- **Dimension** and **Fact** Entity

Both kinds of business entities must be created on top of the existing **Data Builder** objects(tables or views). 

> [!NOTE]
> As all the business objects are supposed to be created by the business users, they only have limited functionalities, filter and association, to operate on the data. Thus, the complex logic must be done in the **Data Builder** objects. 

In the **Fact** entities, add the **Dimension** entity as the attributes of the entity member

## 2. Create new Fact Model or Consumption Model 

## 2.1. Insert the **Fact** entity to create a Consumption Model

## 2.2. Select the fields to expose either from the Fact entity or its associated Dimension entity

## 2.3. Create the perspectives (option)

<pre> It feels very similar to creating a query on the consumption model. </pre>

## 2.4. A Complex Sample

This is a little complex **Consumption Model**. Two **Fact** entities are linked by the same associated **Dimension** entity.
