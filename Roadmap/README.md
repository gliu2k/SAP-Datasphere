# Roadmap to SAP Datasphere

SAP is encouraging customers to transition to Datasphere. 


# 1. Migration

The path has been laid out to ensure a smooth migration and protect the investment in the BW system.

[Introducing the Migration from SAP BW to SAP Datasphere, SAP BW Bridge](https://learning.sap.com/learning-journeys/modernizing-your-data-warehouse-landscape-from-sap-bw-to-sap-datasphere/introducing-the-migration-from-sap-bw-to-sap-datasphere-sap-bw-bridge)

SAP recommends moving to BW Bridge first. It operates on SAP HANA Cloud platform but still includes the ABAP stack, enabling a seamless migration of BW objects.

## 1.1. Migrate to BW Bridge

![alt text](/Roadmap/images/Bridge.png?raw=true)

- There are two ways to migrate the contents from on-promise BW system to BW Bridge.

  - Shell Conversion
Only the metadata of the objects are transferred. The data are reloaded from the source systems (S/4HANA or ERP).

  - Remote Conversion
Both the metadata and data are transferred. This is for the scenario where the historical data are not available in the source systems. After the conversion, the new data will be loaded from the source systems into BW Bridge.

- There are limitations of BW Bridger(See SAP Note 3117800). 
  - Queries are not supported.
  - No support for the OLAP engine and functionality dependent on the OLAP engine, e.g., analysis authorizations, query as InfoProvider, query execution, calculation of non-cumulative key figures (aka inventory key figures).
  - ....
  - 
The ADOs tables are replciated from BW bridge and the models are rebuilt in DataSphere. The new reports are created in SAC.

## 1.2. Load data into DataSphere from the source systems(S/4HANA, ERP)

These are the Methods and Their Drawbacks

- BW SAPI Extractor
  - It may not be a long-term solution.
    
- CDSView Extractor (ODP)
  - Fewer customers develop the custom CDSView with the delta mechanism. 
  [Example](https://github.com/SAP-samples/teched2022-DA281/blob/main/exercises/dd1/README.md)

  - The doable way is to load the delta data from SAP standard CDSViews. 
  [HowTo](https://community.sap.com/t5/enterprise-resource-planning-blogs-by-sap/cds-based-data-extraction-part-ii-delta-handling/ba-p/13425761)

  - We need to rebuild the DataSphere **VIEWs** on top of these CDSViews structures. When we want to make enhancements, are we going to create the custom CDSView by referring to (copying) the SAP standard one?
  
- Tables (SLT)
  - Remodeling
    
# 2. Greenfield - BW SideCar + SLT

I think this approach is better and offers greater flexibility. The workload for remodeling is nearly the same as replicating CDSViews. SLT can replicate the delta data changes of the tables in real-time. We can compare the reports in datasphere side-by-side with the BW system.

# 3. User Management
We can import the users from *CSV* file in GoLive. And, we can synchronize the users and achieve the SSO via SAML. See [Blog](https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blogs-by-members/integrate-sap-data-warehouse-cloud-with-azure-active-directory/ba-p/13480455)


# 4. Delta Data Loading
Generallyï¼Œ this topic should be included in the Flow section in DataBuilder. In fact, the Delta feature is quite simple and straight-forward within SAP DataSphere. We need to consider more when we integrate it with other system like S/4HANA and BW Bridge.

Let's take a quick at the **Delta** within Datasphere. We have talked about delta in the Flow and Model in DataBuilder section. We need to turn on "delta capture" in 
local table and use Transformation Flow to do dalta data loading.

## 4.1. Delta in DataSphere 
### 4.1.1. Full Data Loading 

Source Table - Non-Delta

Target Table - Delta

Transformation flow - We can only choose "Initial Only" in "load type"

In the first execution of **Transformation Flow**, 3 records are loaded into target.
![alt text](/Roadmap/images/AD1.png?raw=true)

We changed 1 record in the source table and run the **Transformation Flow**. All three records are loaded again into the target.
![alt text](/Roadmap/images/AD2.png?raw=true)

The same is shown in the log.
![alt text](/Roadmap/images/log2.png?raw=true)


#### 4.1.2 Delta Data Loading 

Source Table - Delta

Target Table - Detla

Transformation Flow - select "Delta Table" of the source and "Initial and Delta" type

In the first execution of **Transformation Flow**, three records are loaded into the target.
![alt text](/Roadmap/images/AD1.png?raw=true)

We changed 1 record in the source table and run the **Transformation Flow** again. Only the changed record is loaded into the target.
![alt text](/Roadmap/images/AD2.png?raw=true)

The same is shown in the log.
![alt text](/Roadmap/images/log2.png?raw=true)

Detla can be reset.
![alt text](/Roadmap/images/ResetWaterMark.png?raw=true)

- **Summary:**
  - We cannot choose "Initial and Detla" type in Transformation Flow if the source table does not support "Detla".
  - We cannot use the Active Table of the source table which supports "Detla" mode and select "Initial and Delta" type in Transformation Flow. "Initial Only" is the only option.
  - We can choose "Initial Only" type in the first execution of the Transformation Flow but need to change it to "Initial and Delta" type in the consequential execution. (I am thinking why not select "Initial and Delta" in the very beginning.

# 4.2 BW Bridge to DataSphere.

You can find the details in this [blog](https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blogs-by-sap/delta-extraction-of-adso-from-sap-bw-bridge-into-sap-datasphere-via/ba-p/13651788) about how to load the delta data from the changelog table of ADSO in BW bridge. However, it does not include the case when 0RecordMode = 'A'. 

Using BW Bridge(ADSOs) heavily relies on the logic built in the BW system.
