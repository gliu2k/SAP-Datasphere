# Data Analyzer

The connection to SAP HANA/BW does not work in **From a Data Source**. 

Use the connection to Datasphere and connect to an existing Analytic Model.

It looks like a web version of **Analysis for Office**.

**I found a bug. I updated the data in Analytic Model in Datasphere and hit the refresh button in the Data Analyzer. The udpate did not happen. I had to get out of the query and got into it again to see the changes.**
