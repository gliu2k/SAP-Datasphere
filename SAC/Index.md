# SAP Analytics Cloud (SAC)

We know SAP has many reporting tools and Business Objects platforms. SAC is the reporting platform in the cloud. It can connect to BW, S/4HANA, Datasphere, BOBJ and other clouds like Azure, Amazon.

# Description
I first encountered SAP SAC in 2017. I engaged in a project to build the stories to consume the data in S/4HANA Cloud through CDSView Queires.
I have touched it on and off in the past 3 years and noticed it has been keeping evovling. And, I'd like to pick it up as I wnat to study its planning features.
Thus, I will highlight the main funcaitines of some areas but will focus on the planning part.
