# SAP Analytics Cloud (SAC)

SAP offers a variety of reporting tools and BusinessObjects platforms. SAP Analytics Cloud (SAC) is a cloud-based reporting platform. SAC seamlessly connects to SAP BW, S/4HANA, Datasphere, BusinessObjects(BOBJ), and non-SAP cloud platform like Azure and Amazon.

# Description
I first encountered SAP Analytics Cloud (SAC) in 2017 when I worked on a project to build stories(and Digital Boardroom) that consumed the data from S/4HANA Cloud through CDS View Queries. Over the past three years, I've intermittently engaged with SAC and observed its continuous evolution. In this project, I will highlight the main functionalities of various areas, with a particular focus on the planning aspect.

# Requirements

You can get 30days free trial version of SAP Datasphere and SAC from [here](https://www.sap.com/products/technology-platform/cloud-analytics/trial-basic.html).

**All the contents and scenarios in this project are created in my trial version Datasphere and SAC environments.**

## 1. Administration

## 2. Model
- [Modeling](/SAC/Modeling/Index.md)

## 3. Data Analyzer
- [Reporting](/SAC/Reporting/DA_Index.md)

## 4. Stories

## 6. SAP Analytics Cloud Add-In
We need to download and install the Add-in. It will show up in the office toolbar like **Analysis for Office**.
I am not able to connect to SAC trial version. 
  
## 7. Predictive Scenarios
It took too much time to train on a small dataset in a time series forecasting model. I am not sure if it is due to the trail version.
